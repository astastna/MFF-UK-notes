Human eye
- simple structure
- reverted image is projected on the retina
- chromatic abberation 
	- because of different wave length, the colors detected on retina are shifted
	- that means that red version of the image is shifted to different place than the blue 
	version of the image
- there is powerfull image preprocessing in the retina
	- there is ~150x more information from the photosensitive cells than the nerves can
	transfer to the brain
	- the preprocessing is very similar to edge-detecting algorithms in computer graphics
	- there are two kinds of cells in retina 
		- center
		- off center
	- the cells behave like the edge detection matrix 
		- in the middle they magnify the signal (positive number)
		- on the border of the cell they lower the signal (negative number)
	- the main difference is that in computer the process is made sequentely, whereas in the eye
	all possible positions of the matrix are counted in parallel

- post-processing
	- luminance = G + R
	- red-green = G - R
	- blue-yellow = B - (G + R) <=> B - luminance

Definition of color
- color describes at least 3 things
	- property of an object
	- characteristic of light rays
	- human sensation 
- because it depends on processing in human brain, it is very hard to have an exact definition

- who is interested
	- artists
	- physicists, chemists
	- neurologists
	- computer scientists
	- philosophers
	- etc.

History
- antics
	- part of natural phylosophy
	- linear colour models
	- Arisotle
		- colours mixture of white and black
		- linear scale according to perceived brightness
		- partly gained from observations of the sky
		- red in the middle between black and white

- middle ages
	- variations of linear colour ordering systems
	- problems of linear colour ordering systems
		- ordering of colours according to luminance
		- predictions on colour mixing not always right
		- no prospect of additive / subtractive colours
		- places black and white on the same level as colour hues
	- Grosseteste (1230) - improvement of the linear colour system
		- first separation of chroma from hue
- renaissance and later
	- 2- and 3-D colour spaces with the development of natural sciences
	- Alberti (1435) - 3D colour space
	- Leonardo (1510)- 4 primaries
		- is white a proper colour? 
		- is green primary?
	- Newton (1672) - first to take the correct conclusions
		- learned from the fact that white light can be broken to the colours of 
		the rainbow by a prism
		- proved that light is a heterogenous mixture of colours
		- first colour circle
	- J.H. Lambert (1760)
		- tried to describe all colours as a mixture of blue, red and yellow
		- effectively precursor of CMY models
		- not universal colour model - not all colours can be gained through this model
	- Harris (1776) - made colour circles popular
		- only 2D models
	- Goethe (1800) - wrote a lot about colour and thought it to be the main accomplishments
		in his life
		- developed theory which seemed to contradict Newton
		- nowadays the two theories are seemed to describe the same things from different 
		perspective
		- studied colours on the edges 
		- ( colours perceived only on the edges light-dark)
	- Otto Runge (1810) - colour sphere

Physics
- light 
	- electro-magnetic radiation
	- important is the frequency
	- ray of light contanis many arrays with different frequencies
- spectrum 
	- distibution of wavelength intensities per wavelength
- particle / wave
	- lightwaves (usually) behave according to laws of geometric optics
	- diffraction and non-linear optics can be archieved only by wave interpretation
- polarization
	- light is a transverzal wave
	- frequency doesn't give full information about the 2D wave in 3D space
	- polarization is how the plane of the wave is inlined in comparison with xy-plane
	- it is called phase inforation
	- rays with different frequency and different polarization have the same colour, but 
	interact with the matter differently, i.e. difference in reflection, refaction, etc.
	- Heidinger's brush
		- people are able to see the polarization of light
		- it is ornament of yellow and blue thick lines perpendicular to each other
		- the rotation is dependent on the polarization of light
		- can be observed on the sky while having sun behind your back or on white place of 
		an LCD monitor

	- insects 
		- many insects can see polarization of light
		- they are able to have a good orientation thanks to this efect

- LASER
	- Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
	- all photons are in phase and usually in frequency too
	- producest coherent light
	- propagates in almost perfectly straight line

- colour of light
	- when perceiving the emitter directly, only it's characteristics have to be taken into account
	- otherwise the interaction of light with other objects plays significant role

- energy levels
	- each ligth frequency has it's energy level

- visible range
	- the visible range for humans (and more generally by any organic senzor) is given by the 
	minimum and maximum energy levels
	- too high energy levels destroy molecules (UV)
	- too low energy levels are hard to detect and focus on (IR)

- quantum properties of matter
	- only certain discrete states and transitions between them are allowed
	- these states correspond to energy levels and frequencies
	
15 causes of colour
- 1-3 simple exitations and vibrations
- 4,5 transitions involving ligand field effect
- 6,7 transition between molecular orbitals
- 8-11 transitions involving energy bonds
- 12-15 geometry and physical optics

- 1,2 and 11 are self luminous

- 1 colour from incadescence
	- blackbody radiation
		- all matter, regardless of composition, emits light of certain frequencies by given
		temperature
		- infrared - below 800 K 
		- red - Draper point, 800 K
		- white - extremely hot iron
		- blue - plasma in hot stars, 20 000 K
	- Fraunhofer lines
		- when studying the light from the Sun, scientists discovered that there are 
		some frequencies with much less intensities than would be expected 
		- it turned out that some light frequencies are partly absorbed by the atmosphere
		of the Sun
- 2 gass excitation
	- sodium lamps has double emission line
	- Stark shift
		- shifting and splitting of spectral lines thanks to molecule being influenced by 
		electric field
		- with magnetic field it works similarly and is called Zeeman effect
		- can be explained by quantum mechanics
- 3 colour from vibrations and exitation
	- e.g. reason for water being light blue
	- it absorbs light from outside and then emits it as light blue light

- 11 band gap emission
	- LED
		- semiconductor diodes where the transition from one semiconductor to another
		causes certain decrease in energy level for electrons going through the interface
		- the energy is emitted as light
		- emitted energy is exactly one value for given LED
		-> the resulting light is monochromatic
		--> in order to have more "natural" light, more LEDs have to be combined 
		
		- it is hard to design and build, because the emission takes place in an opaque material
		- more energy efficient
		-> are expected to be used more often in the future

- 4 colour from transition metal compounds
	- colour of many minerals and paint pigments
- 5 colour from transition metal impurities
	- occurs in otherwise uncolourful rocks
	- for example ruby, emerald
	- atoms and molecules with electron pairs are hard to excite
	- the amount of energy needed for excitation can be influenced by nearby molecules
	- pure corund (Al2O3) is colorless, 1% of chrome make it ruby
	- ruby is corund based and emerald beryillium base, both get coloured by 1% chrome
	- alexandrite
		- lattice between ruby and emerald
		- green on daylight, red under incadescent ilumination (i.e. blackbody radiation)
	- pleochroism
		- some crystals change their colour according to the viewers point
		- possible only in crystals with multiple axis
		- special form of ligand field effects
		- depends on the orientation of crystal lattice
 
	
- 6 colour in organic compounds
	- some organic compounds contain electrons suitable for absorbtion in visible spectrum
	- e.g. organic dyes
		- fluorescence quite common
		- usually contain structures similar to nucleus of benzene
	- organic molecule reflectence
		- smooth reflectance spectra
		- easy to measure and represent in rendering

Fluorescence
	- re-radiation of energy on different wavelengths
	- quite common, hard to measure
		- need bi-spectral photometers
	- Stokes shift
		- fluorescence for light
	- mostly the fluorescence is at lower energy levels
	- there is transfer of energy
		- at some point the item reflects more energy, than currently absorbs
	
	- bi-colured reflection
		- some light is reflected, some gets inside and undergoes wavelength shift on the 
		colorant molecules
		
- 7 colour from charge transfer 
	- saphire 
		- corund with 1% of iron - colourless
		- corund with 1% of titan - pale yellow
		- corund with 1% of both - deep blue
		-> there is charge transfer between Ti(4+) and Fe(2+)
	-  

- 8 metals, alloys
	- copper, silver, gold
	- in normal molecules, there are single electrons with well-defined energy levels
	- in metals, there are lots of electrons with so many energy levels, that it can be viewed as 
	continuous
	- light can penetrate at most  ~100 atoms deep
	- then it is immediately absorbed
	- efficiency of this process can be wavelength dependent
		- higher energies are less efficient for some materials (copper, gold)
	- direct absorbtion is hard to observe
		- exeption: gold plated sunglasses	

- 9 pure semiconductors
	- silicon, pure diamond, cadmium yellow
	- there is a gap between the conductive and valence band
	-> photons of certain energy aren't absorbed
	- the gap differs for different matters

- 10 doped semiconductors
	- coloured diamonds, LED's
	- the additional atoms/molecules add intermediate levels to the energy gap

- 11 colour centres
	- smoky quartz, amethyst
	- the impurities change the number of electrons locally
	- these places can absorb light on some energy levels

- 12 dispersion
	- rainbows
	- wavelength depends lineary on interference and non-lineary on refraction
	- Sellmeier coefficients describe behaviour of glass and crystals
		- approximations of the dispersion curves
		- sum of quadratic terms with empirical coefficients
		- alternative: Cauchy's formula
	- dispersion sampling, two ways
		- single wavelength in a path tracer
		- trace normaly and add some random jitter to prevent from aliasing effects
	- index of refraction (IOR) depends on wavelength
	- light is split into its spectral elements
	- normal dispersion
		- rainbow
		- index of refraction decreases with wavelength
	- anomalous dispersion
		- index of refraction behaves non-lineary
		- partially reversed prismatic colours
	- dependency with absorbtion
		- IOR and absorbtion influence each other
		- there are Kramers-Kronig relations to calculate one from the other
		- anomalous dispersion occurs around absorbtion frequencies
	- extinction coefficient - how much something absorbs light (per mass or number of molecules)
	- experiment
		- take three solutions with different concetration of some special chemical
		- compare with prisms
		-> extinction coefficient doesn't influence IOR
	- rendering
		- for some materials, anomalous dispersion cannot be neglected 

- 13 scattering
	- blue of the sky
	= deflecting the direction of light in transparent environment
	- the air deflects rays of light
	- isn't dependent on aerosols in the air - it makes even the pure air
	- wavelength dependency - reason for blue sky and red sunsets

- 14 interference
	- butterfly wings
	- tiny structures can change the way the material looks like
	- small differences in the propagation of light can lead to cancellation or reinforcement
	- metallic and pearlescent colours
		- goniochromism - colour changes with viewing angle
		- micro and macro appearance differs
	- structural colour
		- extermely intense colours
		- highly resistent to UV
		- mechanically vulnerable
		- practically always change hue with viewing angle
	- pigment colour
		- doesn't change colour
		- less intense
		- tends to fade out with time (destroyed by UV)
		- 
	
- 15 difraction
	- opal, diffraction gratings
 
Solid colours vs. light
- in CIE Lab, L = 100 is white (<=> "light")

Band pass vs. band gap
- monochromatic colour
	- spectrum shows only narrow band in which the right colour goes
	- almost black
- band gap colours
	- caused by narrow gap in the band
	- almost white
	- spectrum shows everything but a small gap
- highly colourful paints have to be full colours or semichromes
- full colours have maximum colour content for given hue
- band limits have to be at complementary wavelengths

Human visual system
- main organ - eyes
- vision cca 80% of all human perception
- postprocessing is needed in order to get some insight
- not all of the processes in visual perception are understood
	- luckily, the exterior ones, which are mainly important for colour science, are good-known
	- exterior = processing
- visual cortex
	- part of brain responsible for vision
	- at the back of the head
	- optical nerves cross each other
	- something happens also in the inner part of the brain (as the signals go through it), but
	it is not well understood
	

Human eye
- the reversed image is projected on the retina
- chromatic aberation 
	- e.g. red version of the image is shifted differently than blue, green, etc.
- retina
	- some preprocessing needed here
	- there are photosensitive cells
		- rods
			- cannot detect colour
			- almost in all parts of retina but fovea
			- responsible for night and low- light vision
			- achromatic vision
			- react slower to the light, the signal lasts longer time
			- has photosensitive pigment rhodopsin inside
			- it is called purple vision - absorbs yellow/green, transmits purple
		- cons
			- 3 kinds - red, green, blue
			- mainly in fovea
			- responsible for colur vision
			- react quickly, the signal is short, fire 4x faster than rods
	- the cells have light sensitive tips
	- can register single photons
	- there are also nerves and blood vessels around the photosenitive cells
	- all four types of photosensitive cells have it's own photopigment
		- based on a chromoforic grup
		- connected to the opsin protein
- bleaching
	- electrochemical reaction, which converts incident photons to nerve stimuli
- receptor absorbance
	- blue cons
	- rods
	- green cons
	- red cons
	- red: green : blue <=> 40 : 20 : 1
- fovea
	- the yellow spot
	- part of retina with highest concentration of photosensitive cells
	- only place, where humans really perceive substantial colour stimuli
	- outside fovea, most of cons are of the blue type
- stimuli
	- the intensity of nerural stimuli depends on intensity of light and 
	on the sensitivity of the cell to the given frequency
	- e.g. blue con sends same signal for weak blue light and strong red light
- dark adaptation
	- rods react slower, are capable to handle lower light intensity
	- cons react faster, have higher treshold
- retinal blood vessels
	- structure of vessels is specific for every person
	-> use in biometry
- neural processing in retina
	- in retina following preprocessing is made
		- edge enhancement
		- colour separation
		- signals from rods and cons are separated
- ganglion receptive field
	- receptors grouped together to provide edge detection
	- explanation for Hermann grid
- visual acucity
	- depends on absolute intensity of iluminaton
	- rods are better in low light, with more light cons are better
- colour constancy
	- perceived colour is not much dependent on the colour of iluminant

Metamerism
- two stimuli are in colour match if the amount of R,G,B is the same through the whole spectrum
- this can lead to two "same" stimuli with completely different spectral distributions
- occurs frequently in real life
- interesting problem in printing industry, in monitors etc.
- two stimuli are metameric if they match in colour but have different spectral distribution
	-> sensorically indistinguishable
- metameric failure
	- if metameric stimuly stop matching because of change of observer or lightsource
- colour rendering index (CRI)
	- used for measuring of metamerism
	- colours are compared (in CIE) under standardised and measured iluminant
	- not aplicable for colourful light
	- includes white adaptation
	- sample colours taken from original Munsell book of colour
		- no longer physically available
		-> nowadays Munsell includes only metamers
- metameric failure
	- sample / iluminant
		- same object looks different under different iluminants
	- observer
		- things looking alike doesn't look alike for others
		- e.g. monitors, cameras, other species
	- geometrical 
		- same object looks different from different angles
- test image - metacow
	- many cows with halves with different reflectance spectrums
	- for humans look alike

Colour blidness
- much more common by males (the red-green version)
- also called daltonism
- protanopia - absence of red pigment
- deuteropia - absence of green pigment
- tritanope - blue-yellow blindness, quite rare
	- equally distributed between men and woman
- complete colour blindness is very rare
- special pictures are used to detect it
- there are also some differences in absorbtion characteristics between humans

Anomaloscope
- person is asked to mix RGB lights to match given colour

Alien vision
- many technologies allow us to "see" outside the normal visible frequencies
- medium and long wave IR cameras
	- have metal lens opaque to visible light
- milimetre wave imaging
	- recent technology
	- still problems with resolution and frame rate
	- emitted by human skin
	- passive, not harmful
	- can go through fog and cloths
		- usage in security scanning
- X-ray backscatter
	- penetrates all closings and cover
	- not harmful
	- still controversial
Optical illusions
- anomalous movement
	- caused by
		- involuntary eye movements
		- hardwired edge and movement detection in retina


Colorimetry
- goal to represent colour in a way which is 
	- reproducible
	- expressive
	- meaningful
	- consistent
- branch of science 
- is concerned in numeric representations of given visual stimuli
	- stimuli with same specification look alike in same viewing conditions
	- stimuli which look alike have the same representation
	- numbers are continuous functions of physical parameters
CIE
- Commision International of l'Eclairage
- international standards body of human perception and colours
- CIE colorimetric system - base for other systems
- Base Colorimetry Terms (BCT)

CME principle
- it is possible to represent all colours with 3 representants
- but not single 3 ones
-> reason why negative red is needed

Maxwell matching
- two primaries and measured light are compared to white
- more accurate near predefined white

Maximum saturation matching

Colour matching
- several laws
	- symmetry
	- transitivity (sometimes problematic in reality)
	- additivity
	- proportionality (still matches after scaling)
- is equivalence, because reflexivity holds of course too



- sometimes we need the distance between colors
- for example order of some product, +- distance ?
- circle around x,y

- MacAdams's Ellipses
- not circles, ellipses
- we are sensitive in the lower part of the x,y,z digagram

- different people see different ellipses, also the same person in different time has diffrent results

- 1960 - people are trying to stretch the diagram to make the ellipses circles
- partially successful
- it is important to understand that this is a 3D problem, as luminiscence is also non-linear

- 1976 - scientists asking people from movie and printing industry
- film industry quite ... with CIE 1960 -> L*u*v
	- has maximum
	- the color is dependent on the maximum light in your scene
	- incadescent ilumination	
		- color of light
		- we can normalize it quite quickly in our brain
		- we can stab to the colour of our light
	- the cut through the central part is also not linear (ellipses instead of circles)
	- not much in use
- designers wanted something, where coordinates made sense -> L*a*b
	- a b are axes
	- a is red-green, b is yellow-blue
	- in photography, we change b to balance the white
	- 
- in both systems hue can be expressed through angle and luminiscence through the distance from center
- we can also count hue difference (for a designer, the distance in luminiscence is not so bad as in hue)

- LCH - Lab in radial coordinates
- CIE 94 - computing the difference in LCH space with correction coeficients (domain specific)
	- to make it most linear for different domains
- CIEDE200 - adding another part to the difference equation 
	- RT - blue rotation
	- quite complicated
	- implementation can be downloaded
	- always check your implementation with the sample one

- there is no colour space perfect for every task

- CIELAB - not perceptually uniform
	- some corrections in the way of counting the difference

Beyond colour spaces
- device colour spaces (RGB, CMYK)
- colour metric spaces (Lab, Luv)
	- roots in colorimetry, to measure values and differences
- colour ordering spaces (munsell, coloroid)
	- to find colour of some property

- people are trying to make color samples

Colour collections
- primary aim to provide a list of numbered sample colours
- no ordering - not a color space
- usually some order
- used in product specifications
- physical samples provided usually, matching is done against them

RAL-Farben
- RAL classic - box of colours 
	- RAL 4010 for example
	- loose standard, guide
	- how much does my colour differ from the sample is between me and customer
	- no sorting
	- delta i - under 1 not perceptable, over two perceptable, over 5 huge difference

FS 595
	- five digit numbers
	- enumeration of colours for U.S. military purposes

Pantone
	- enumeration of colours and a specification of how to get them
	- one can get certified colorants and then he can get certified colors through the receipts
	- only some of it can be obtained by the standard CMYK


- people compare colours on day light
-> there are boxes which can simulate the standardised light conditions

Colour ordering systems
- Absolute COS
	- RAL Design, Munsell 
	- each entry associated with unique colours

- Relative COS
	- HSV, HLS
	- front-ends to colour spaces
	- HSV coordinates are not unique

TV colour spaces
- NTSC - backword compatible solution
- YIQ
- YuV
- YCbCr
- luminance abbreviated as Y
- 
Colour Collections
	Pantone
	
Colour Ordering System Sub-Types
Absolute
	- pick a colour with given number
	- 
Relative
	- 

Munsell COS
- Hue
	- 5 basic colors + 5 between + 0 - 9 scale between them
		-> 5 is exactly between 2 colors
- Value
	- 1-10
	- 
- Color space 
	- non-linear because of perceptual reasons

Natural Color System
- swedish, good designers
- standard for interior design
- mainly color appearence

- Hue
	- 6 basic colors (without purple)
	- black chromaticness Y90R
	- Primalex uses NCS
		- many builders use NCS
	
RAL design
- small atlas
- they took care to make the colors easily manufacturable


Beamers
- 3D movies - the beamer can't be brighter because of physical limits
		- screen big and glasses filter another part of the light 
		- too much heat from light

- laser beamers
	- really beatyful colours
	- we don't waste any light on filtering
	
	- small ones
		- red and blue lasers are common
		- green laser have been created only recently
		- in this boxes they use native green diodes
		
- the whole movie industry moved to much larger color space lately
	- anticipation of better technology?

Reproduction
- photographic film
	- only really durable
	- high contrast, good color gamut
- Russia, 1910
	- take 3 photographs with red, green and blue filters
	- then colored the negatives and gave it together
	- no color degradation
	- travelled around Russia
		-> many colorful images of Russia from ~1910

Printers
- CMYK
	- non-linear
		- teoretically linear, but not in reality
	- printable color space is smaller, than the one displayable
	- in green and blue we can print what can't be displayed
	-> solved by gamut mapping
- Gamut mapping
	- global
		- trying to shrink all the points inside the printable area
		- the difference between details stays the same
	- local
		- projection of the points outside of the colour space into it
		- destroys the relation between neighbouring details
		- (-8, 5, -10) the negative values can't be projected on 0, because that would change the hue
		- actually we need to project the color in the direction to the white point
			-> iterative methods
Research
- we usually don't see what has been done on the university
	- great part of funding for postgraduate students
- research takes a long time and is succesful only sometimes
- 55 000 a month for carrier in these projects
	- there exist a specific grant, which allow that
	-> think about postgraduate studium

Color reproduction
- colors are non-linear - on different surfaces the amount of color reflected differs
	- for example all red is reflected, but almost no green, etc.
	- (the teacher uses ColorSync Utility - color space for different printers can be shown)
	- the color space which can be shown on the monitor is different from the one which can be printed
		- cyan, dark green, purple - monitors are bad at that colors
		- on the other hand, printers can reproduce dark green quite well
		- it is not easy to print a magazine ...
		- what we see that bright green can be displayed but can't be printed 
			-> we have to get this color inside the color space of the printer somehow
			=> gamut mapping
Gamut mapping
- big gap between additive and subtractive methods
- story - one of his students discovered that one specie doesn't fit into picture when photographed
	-> trying to catch the real color of that animal, because it is very rare

	- global
		- we shift all colors to preserve the overall feeling from the picture
		- one would say that this is best for the photographs, beause contrast stays the same
		- however, nobody uses it in reality, because the colors are too pale then
		- instead, some non-linear shrinking is used
	- local 
		- we only change the colors which are outside the given space

Inkjets
- color inkjets are becoming rare nowdays
- big drawback - price of ink
		- ink dries up
- color quality is better then by laserjets
- modern color printer has 6 or 7 types of ink
	- dark and light cyan
	- dark and light magenta
	- yellow
	- dark and light black

- work well just on certain materials
	- on photographic paper the pictures are better than on normal paper
	- on the photographic paper has a small drains which make the ink to go deep and the resulting dots are smaller 

- types of heads
	- bubble head
		- we have a small pipe with ink
		- the end of the pipe is heated and a bubble of ink falls on the paper
		- we try to get smallest dots possible
		- ink requirements
			- not too liquid, so paper is not too softened
			- liquid enough to penetrate the paper
			- non-toxic, non-flammable
			- oh, wait, also colorful :D
	- piezo heads
		- only surviving to these days
		- Epson
		- print head is more expensive

Laser printers
	- fast
	- low cost per page
	- expensive
	- reduced gamut
	- not capable of any additional colours
	- in most cases no laser inside these days
	- basically computer controlled photocopier

	- electrostatic printing
		- invented in 1938 
		- we charge part of the paper and make the toner parts get there
		- it is possible to make it work also without computer
		- old photocopies were made only through group of lenses which transported the reflected light to charge some parts of paper
			-> reason for bad contrast of old copies
		- nowdays everywhere is negative charge and the laser gets it away in some parts
		- LED diods are often used instead of lasers because they work faster for wide printers 
		- but their spectrum is not uniform
	- toners
		- small particles
		- by inkjets, the ink physically over the paper
		- toner is on the surface
			-> reason for being waterproof
	- how to get the right amount of toner on the page?
		- brush - that wouldn't work after tousands of pages
		-> tiny iron particles on an electromagnet, after print the stream gets away, it falls to a reservoir
		- nowdays it is not needed any more, because the amount of toner pieces on the drum gets reduced to one layer by a shade
	- the laser printers are quite small, because basically you need the paper to go through and get charged

Offset printers
	- first printers which were compatible with digitalisation
		-> influenced the color representation in software
	- durability, speed, cheap for large volumes
		-> cheaper ink
	- companies printing newspapers order inks by tons, not kilograms
	- we have printing sheet from aluminium
	- the sheet is rough and when we give water on it, it sticks (precisely)
	- after the water, we put oily ink on the sheet and it sticks only to places where there's no water
	- there is an offset cylinder, to which gets the ink and from which the paper gets coloured
		- paper is soft and got squashed 
		- discovered by accident - a rubber cylinder under the sheet
			- one turn without paper
			- the next paper got ink from both sides and one side has been sharper
	- excellent gamut
	- additional colours possible - gold, silver, etc.
	- extreme speed
	- not suitable for small series
	- small offset printer - can be sutiable for tousands of pages

	- newspaper print - they don't need to use heat, because the ink gets quicly into the paper
	- magazines use different paper and heating is usually needed to get the ink into the paper
		-> different machines are used for magazines and newspapers

Pantone Hexachrome
- pantone standard for printers
- upper bound on what is possible to print

Measurement technologies
	- photometry - intensity
		- basic unit - lumen
		- sensitivity of average human observer
		- spectrophotometry - doesn't make sense really, because we don't perceive the whole spectrum 
	- colorimetry - color value measuments
		- basically a single pixel camera
		- same for decades, only getting more user friendly
	- spectroradiometry - measuring the frequencies of the image
		- radiometry - electromagnetic stuff
		- spectroradiometry - electromagnetic radiation, with concern for human
		- units - Joules, Watts 
			- we measure energy per m^2, angle (and second) etc.
			- the same units are for radiometry, but with different subscript
				- tiny integral in definiton
		- when taking some light
			- radiometry counts everything under curve
			- photometry gives bad coefficient for spectra, which aren't perceived much by human and 
			a good coefficient to the important frequencies 
				-> multiplying by a "gaussian peak" of human sensitivity 
	
Measurements
- photometry, colorimetry - see previous lesson
- calibration of brightness measurements
	- could be done by different ways
	- shining of black body
		- around absolute zero
		- but this temperature is quite hard to obtain
	- reference lamps
		- instead, we use the shining of gold by a given temperature
		- gold is used because it doesn't oxidize
		- for example iron creates a layer of oxids around it when getting to high temperature
		-> gold is more accurate
		- now special lamps are created using this principle
		- burning time is limited
	- exactly calibrated detector
		- another possible way to do the calibration
		- it is quite difficult to create it
		- but by low temperatures it is possible and sometimes used
	- surface with exact reflection
		- used e.g. by photograpers, a table of appropriate material
		- table has different shades of grey and some basic colours
		-> photograph then can be normalized such that the colours the same as they really look like
- monochromators
	- devices which produce monochromatic light
	- prism monochromator
		- using two lens and a prism such that the wave length is normalized enough
	- grating type monochromator
		- it is possible to read a CD/DVD through it
		- uses mirrors and a grading table
		- light gets normalized through refraction
	- spectro-radiometer 
		- uses the principle of grating type monochromator
		- has something more on the beginning and end
	- filters
		- usually too wide-band
		- 
	- lyot filters
		- using liqid crystals
		- many layers, each one frequency band
	- lasers
		- expensive
		- inflexible - only one wave length
- there is lamp measurement lab
		- they measure characteristics of different tlamps
		- in Prague
		- 3D model of brightness
- viewing booths
	- special boxes with well-defined light environment
	- companies use it to compare their products and check that the colour is the right one
Digital printing
- we have whole pipeline of devices - scanner, monitor, ink printer, offset printer
	-> the goal is to make the picture seem the same on each of these devices
- it is problematic, because e.g. monitor has additive colours, but ink printer is subtractive
- solution:
	- PCS - Profile Connection Space (CIELAB)
		- colour space common for all devices
		- input is not the problem - colour spaces of input devices have usually smaller colour spaces
		- output is problem, because I have to know the parameters of output device and furthermore I go from larger space to smaller one
		-> I have to solve what to do with colours outside the colour space
			- there are more ways to do that as has been said during previous lessons
- we have to calibrate the devices
	- projector/monitor
		- a camera and program with specified colours
		- it measures the RGB curves and changes the input accordingly
	- printer
		- different printing technologies, papers, inks, ...
		- the printers are not calibrated, but built to fit a certain standard
			- Japanese standard
			- American standard
		- the data are in CMYK, it is better because the printers are calibrated to these pigments
		- however, then they are limited to implicit gamut of industry standard CMYK printers
		- L*a*b - perfect for this, but CMYK is still used
		- literatura - Jan-Peter Hoffman - Digital colour management

	- camera
		- Apple is using a small colour space - Apple RGB, new iPhones have P3
		- Adobe has a greater one
		- if I have 8 bits per chanell - in jpg each colour has 8 bits and too wide colour space, I have to waste more space for colour representation
		- PDF X	
			- acronym for PDF Exchange
		- HDR images
			- OpenEXR - open source, BSD style license
Printers
- it is hard to calibrate them
- if we wanted to do it the same as with monitors, we would need to print hundreads of pages
- every printer uses different technology, different paper
- the behaviour is non-linear
- usually, colour wedges are printed
	- they have linear scale whith different shades of black and other colours
	- important is that every segment is different from the one next to him
	- we can notice the rest of it e.g. on tetra pack 

Paper Type characteristics
	- tone value increase
	- how much ink is soaked into the paper
		- through TVI
			- a raster with dots of different size is printed (dots are lineary greater and greater) 
			- then the size of dots is measured
			-> TVI curve - difference of reality and what has been printed
		- is slightly non-linear to the amount of ink

Video installations and virtual reality
- on buildings etc.
- an ability to light a beamer on a surface to make it white and without structure
- then other colors and stuff can be added
- not only colours, but space calibration
- virtual reality has been used to find out how spiders get orientated in the space

White Balance, Colour Appearance Transform (CAT)
- colour constancy
- chromatic adaptation - what our brain does
- white balance - what we need the camera to do to make the colours see the same
	- sometimes we don't want to do it - e.g. sunset looks horrible
	- it's goal is to make the picture seem the same as it perceived the person how took it
	- not only eyes compensate the picture in a way, but also brain
	- even laptops have now the ability to adaptate the monitor to the intensity of light
	
- algorithms for white balance - determining iluminant
	- white patch
		- assumes that brightest pixel is white
	- gray world
		- assumes that on average there are all values from white to black
		- basically getting the center of gravity to the middle
		- doesn't work well with highly colourful scenes
	- gamut constraint
		- assumption is that the colour space of picture have the same shape as the one in reality
	- robotics - make the robot to find a yellow ball
		- it is really hard
		- the RGB values can't be hard-coded
   
- algorithms for white balance - determining how would the picture look like with different illuminant
	- matrix adaptation
		- transformation matrix, source and destination white as input

- people can tell apart white box in orange light and orange box in white light, which shouldn't be possible
	- still not understood
	- a colour scientist has a theory, that the direct ilumination is the same, but the indirect not
		- indirect ilumination of white on orange gets more orange with every refraction
		- indirect ilumination of orange on white doesn't change
		

Raytracing
- counting where the ray coming into the eye has come from 

CWNI - Colured World, Neutral Iluminants
- uses raytracing, but without light source
- then chroma of that is counted and subtracted from the original image
	-> we get non-colurful stuff
	- then we extract the colour of iluminant from that
- used to do the correction
White balance
	- what we do in computer to correct colors
Colour adaptation 
	- what our brani and eyes do, so we perceive the colours of the objects the same
	- no matter the light environment
Hue
- how differs the given light stimulus from red, green and blue

Lightness
- brightness relative to the brightness of white object perceived under the same conditions
 brightness / brightness of white

Brightness
- amount of light

Colorfulness
- perceived quantity of hue content in a stimulus

Saturation
- colorfulness of object realtive to it's own brightness

Chroma 
- colourfulness of an object relatively to the brightness of white object under similar viewing conditions

See presentation from Mr. Fairchild (from conference)

How luminance impacts color?
- high luminance display
	- why TV's aren't high luminance? it would be easier than 3D, HDR, ...
	-> colors behave differently
- eye trackers
	- if we know in which parts of the image people look the most
	- we can render well only that part
	- mostly not done because it is more problematic to measure it than to render it
	- but can be used by interactive rate-racing

- a whole technology can be built around color science

- a lot of scientific work is about meeting people and exchanging ideas
- interaction is needed
