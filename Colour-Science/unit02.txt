Human visual system
- main organ - eyes
- vision cca 80% of all human perception
- postprocessing is needed in order to get some insight
- not all of the processes in visual perception are understood
	- luckily, the exterior ones, which are mainly important for colour science, are good-known
	- exterior = processing
- visual cortex
	- part of brain responsible for vision
	- at the back of the head
	- optical nerves cross each other
	- something happens also in the inner part of the brain (as the signals go through it), but
	it is not well understood
	

Human eye
- the reversed image is projected on the retina
- chromatic aberation 
	- e.g. red version of the image is shifted differently than blue, green, etc.
- retina
	- some preprocessing needed here
	- there are photosensitive cells
		- rods
			- cannot detect colour
			- almost in all parts of retina but fovea
			- responsible for night and low- light vision
			- achromatic vision
			- react slower to the light, the signal lasts longer time
			- has photosensitive pigment rhodopsin inside
			- it is called purple vision - absorbs yellow/green, transmits purple
		- cons
			- 3 kinds - red, green, blue
			- mainly in fovea
			- responsible for colur vision
			- react quickly, the signal is short, fire 4x faster than rods
	- the cells have light sensitive tips
	- can register single photons
	- there are also nerves and blood vessels around the photosenitive cells
	- all four types of photosensitive cells have it's own photopigment
		- based on a chromoforic grup
		- connected to the opsin protein
- bleaching
	- electrochemical reaction, which converts incident photons to nerve stimuli
- receptor absorbance
	- blue cons
	- rods
	- green cons
	- red cons
	- red: green : blue <=> 40 : 20 : 1
- fovea
	- the yellow spot
	- part of retina with highest concentration of photosensitive cells
	- only place, where humans really perceive substantial colour stimuli
	- outside fovea, most of cons are of the blue type
- stimuli
	- the intensity of nerural stimuli depends on intensity of light and 
	on the sensitivity of the cell to the given frequency
	- e.g. blue con sends same signal for weak blue light and strong red light
- dark adaptation
	- rods react slower, are capable to handle lower light intensity
	- cons react faster, have higher treshold
- retinal blood vessels
	- structure of vessels is specific for every person
	-> use in biometry
- neural processing in retina
	- in retina following preprocessing is made
		- edge enhancement
		- colour separation
		- signals from rods and cons are separated
- ganglion receptive field
	- receptors grouped together to provide edge detection
	- explanation for Hermann grid
- visual acucity
	- depends on absolute intensity of iluminaton
	- rods are better in low light, with more light cons are better
- colour constancy
	- perceived colour is not much dependent on the colour of iluminant

Metamerism
- two stimuli are in colour match if the amount of R,G,B is the same through the whole spectrum
- this can lead to two "same" stimuli with completely different spectral distributions
- occurs frequently in real life
- interesting problem in printing industry, in monitors etc.
- two stimuli are metameric if they match in colour but have different spectral distribution
	-> sensorically indistinguishable
- metameric failure
	- if metameric stimuly stop matching because of change of observer or lightsource
- colour rendering index (CRI)
	- used for measuring of metamerism
	- colours are compared (in CIE) under standardised and measured iluminant
	- not aplicable for colourful light
	- includes white adaptation
	- sample colours taken from original Munsell book of colour
		- no longer physically available
		-> nowadays Munsell includes only metamers
- metameric failure
	- sample / iluminant
		- same object looks different under different iluminants
	- observer
		- things looking alike doesn't look alike for others
		- e.g. monitors, cameras, other species
	- geometrical 
		- same object looks different from different angles
- test image - metacow
	- many cows with halves with different reflectance spectrums
	- for humans look alike

Colour blidness
- much more common by males (the red-green version)
- also called daltonism
- protanopia - absence of red pigment
- deuteropia - absence of green pigment
- tritanope - blue-yellow blindness, quite rare
	- equally distributed between men and woman
- complete colour blindness is very rare
- special pictures are used to detect it
- there are also some differences in absorbtion characteristics between humans

Anomaloscope
- person is asked to mix RGB lights to match given colour

Alien vision
- many technologies allow us to "see" outside the normal visible frequencies
- medium and long wave IR cameras
	- have metal lens opaque to visible light
- milimetre wave imaging
	- recent technology
	- still problems with resolution and frame rate
	- emitted by human skin
	- passive, not harmful
	- can go through fog and cloths
		- usage in security scanning
- X-ray backscatter
	- penetrates all closings and cover
	- not harmful
	- still controversial
Optical illusions
- anomalous movement
	- caused by
		- involuntary eye movements
		- hardwired edge and movement detection in retina
