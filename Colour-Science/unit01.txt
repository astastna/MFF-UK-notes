Human eye
- simple structure
- reverted image is projected on the retina
- chromatic abberation 
	- because of different wave length, the colors detected on retina are shifted
	- that means that red version of the image is shifted to different place than the blue 
	version of the image
- there is powerfull image preprocessing in the retina
	- there is ~150x more information from the photosensitive cells than the nerves can
	transfer to the brain
	- the preprocessing is very similar to edge-detecting algorithms in computer graphics
	- there are two kinds of cells in retina 
		- center
		- off center
	- the cells behave like the edge detection matrix 
		- in the middle they magnify the signal (positive number)
		- on the border of the cell they lower the signal (negative number)
	- the main difference is that in computer the process is made sequentely, whereas in the eye
	all possible positions of the matrix are counted in parallel

- post-processing
	- luminance = G + R
	- red-green = G - R
	- blue-yellow = B - (G + R) <=> B - luminance

Definition of color
- color describes at least 3 things
	- property of an object
	- characteristic of light rays
	- human sensation 
- because it depends on processing in human brain, it is very hard to have an exact definition

- who is interested
	- artists
	- physicists, chemists
	- neurologists
	- computer scientists
	- philosophers
	- etc.

History
- antics
	- part of natural phylosophy
	- linear colour models
	- Arisotle
		- colours mixture of white and black
		- linear scale according to perceived brightness
		- partly gained from observations of the sky
		- red in the middle between black and white

- middle ages
	- variations of linear colour ordering systems
	- problems of linear colour ordering systems
		- ordering of colours according to luminance
		- predictions on colour mixing not always right
		- no prospect of additive / subtractive colours
		- places black and white on the same level as colour hues
	- Grosseteste (1230) - improvement of the linear colour system
		- first separation of chroma from hue
- renaissance and later
	- 2- and 3-D colour spaces with the development of natural sciences
	- Alberti (1435) - 3D colour space
	- Leonardo (1510)- 4 primaries
		- is white a proper colour? 
		- is green primary?
	- Newton (1672) - first to take the correct conclusions
		- learned from the fact that white light can be broken to the colours of 
		the rainbow by a prism
		- proved that light is a heterogenous mixture of colours
		- first colour circle
	- J.H. Lambert (1760)
		- tried to describe all colours as a mixture of blue, red and yellow
		- effectively precursor of CMY models
		- not universal colour model - not all colours can be gained through this model
	- Harris (1776) - made colour circles popular
		- only 2D models
	- Goethe (1800) - wrote a lot about colour and thought it to be the main accomplishments
		in his life
		- developed theory which seemed to contradict Newton
		- nowadays the two theories are seemed to describe the same things from different 
		perspective
		- studied colours on the edges 
		- ( colours perceived only on the edges light-dark)
	- Otto Runge (1810) - colour sphere

Physics
- light 
	- electro-magnetic radiation
	- important is the frequency
	- ray of light contanis many arrays with different frequencies
- spectrum 
	- distibution of wavelength intensities per wavelength
- particle / wave
	- lightwaves (usually) behave according to laws of geometric optics
	- diffraction and non-linear optics can be archieved only by wave interpretation
- polarization
	- light is a transverzal wave
	- frequency doesn't give full information about the 2D wave in 3D space
	- polarization is how the plane of the wave is inlined in comparison with xy-plane
	- it is called phase inforation
	- rays with different frequency and different polarization have the same colour, but 
	interact with the matter differently, i.e. difference in reflection, refaction, etc.
	- Heidinger's brush
		- people are able to see the polarization of light
		- it is ornament of yellow and blue thick lines perpendicular to each other
		- the rotation is dependent on the polarization of light
		- can be observed on the sky while having sun behind your back or on white place of 
		an LCD monitor

	- insects 
		- many insects can see polarization of light
		- they are able to have a good orientation thanks to this efect

- LASER
	- Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
	- all photons are in phase and usually in frequency too
	- producest coherent light
	- propagates in almost perfectly straight line

- colour of light
	- when perceiving the emitter directly, only it's characteristics have to be taken into account
	- otherwise the interaction of light with other objects plays significant role

- energy levels
	- each ligth frequency has it's energy level

- visible range
	- the visible range for humans (and more generally by any organic senzor) is given by the 
	minimum and maximum energy levels
	- too high energy levels destroy molecules (UV)
	- too low energy levels are hard to detect and focus on (IR)

- quantum properties of matter
	- only certain discrete states and transitions between them are allowed
	- these states correspond to energy levels and frequencies
	
15 causes of colour
- 1-3 simple exitations and vibrations
- 4,5 transitions involving ligand field effect
- 6,7 transition between molecular orbitals
- 8-11 transitions involving energy bonds
- 12-15 geometry and physical optics

- 1,2 and 11 are self luminous

- 1 colour from incadescence
	- blackbody radiation
		- all matter, regardless of composition, emits light of certain frequencies by given
		temperature
		- infrared - below 800 K 
		- red - Draper point, 800 K
		- white - extremely hot iron
		- blue - plasma in hot stars, 20 000 K
	- Fraunhofer lines
		- when studying the light from the Sun, scientists discovered that there are 
		some frequencies with much less intensities than would be expected 
		- it turned out that some light frequencies are partly absorbed by the atmosphere
		of the Sun
- 2 gass excitation
	- sodium lamps has double emission line
	- Stark shift
		- shifting and splitting of spectral lines thanks to molecule being influenced by 
		electric field
		- with magnetic field it works similarly and is called Zeeman effect
		- can be explained by quantum mechanics
- 3 colour from vibrations and exitation
	- e.g. reason for water being light blue
	- it absorbs light from outside and then emits it as light blue light

- 11 band gap emission
	- LED
		- semiconductor diodes where the transition from one semiconductor to another
		causes certain decrease in energy level for electrons going through the interface
		- the energy is emitted as light
		- emitted energy is exactly one value for given LED
		-> the resulting light is monochromatic
		--> in order to have more "natural" light, more LEDs have to be combined 
		
		- it is hard to design and build, because the emission takes place in an opaque material
		- more energy efficient
		-> are expected to be used more often in the future

- 4 colour from transition metal compounds
	- colour of many minerals and paint pigments
- 5 colour from transition metal impurities
	- occurs in otherwise uncolourful rocks
	- for example ruby, emerald
	- atoms and molecules with electron pairs are hard to excite
	- the amount of energy needed for excitation can be influenced by nearby molecules
	- pure corund (Al2O3) is colorless, 1% of chrome make it ruby
	- ruby is corund based and emerald beryillium base, both get coloured by 1% chrome
	- alexandrite
		- lattice between ruby and emerald
		- green on daylight, red under incadescent ilumination (i.e. blackbody radiation)
	- pleochroism
		- some crystals change their colour according to the viewers point
		- possible only in crystals with multiple axis
		- special form of ligand field effects
		- depends on the orientation of crystal lattice
 
	
- 6 colour in organic compounds
	- some organic compounds contain electrons suitable for absorbtion in visible spectrum
	- e.g. organic dyes
		- fluorescence quite common
		- usually contain structures similar to nucleus of benzene
	- organic molecule reflectence
		- smooth reflectance spectra
		- easy to measure and represent in rendering

Fluorescence
	- re-radiation of energy on different wavelengths
	- quite common, hard to measure
		- need bi-spectral photometers
	- Stokes shift
		- fluorescence for light
	- mostly the fluorescence is at lower energy levels
	- there is transfer of energy
		- at some point the item reflects more energy, than currently absorbs
	
	- bi-colured reflection
		- some light is reflected, some gets inside and undergoes wavelength shift on the 
		colorant molecules
		
- 7 colour from charge transfer 
	- saphire 
		- corund with 1% of iron - colourless
		- corund with 1% of titan - pale yellow
		- corund with 1% of both - deep blue
		-> there is charge transfer between Ti(4+) and Fe(2+)
	-  

- 8 metals, alloys
	- copper, silver, gold
	- in normal molecules, there are single electrons with well-defined energy levels
	- in metals, there are lots of electrons with so many energy levels, that it can be viewed as 
	continuous
	- light can penetrate at most  ~100 atoms deep
	- then it is immediately absorbed
	- efficiency of this process can be wavelength dependent
		- higher energies are less efficient for some materials (copper, gold)
	- direct absorbtion is hard to observe
		- exeption: gold plated sunglasses	

- 9 pure semiconductors
	- silicon, pure diamond, cadmium yellow
	- there is a gap between the conductive and valence band
	-> photons of certain energy aren't absorbed
	- the gap differs for different matters

- 10 doped semiconductors
	- coloured diamonds, LED's
	- the additional atoms/molecules add intermediate levels to the energy gap

- 11 colour centres
	- smoky quartz, amethyst
	- the impurities change the number of electrons locally
	- these places can absorb light on some energy levels

- 12 dispersion
	- rainbows
	- wavelength depends lineary on interference and non-lineary on refraction
	- Sellmeier coefficients describe behaviour of glass and crystals
		- approximations of the dispersion curves
		- sum of quadratic terms with empirical coefficients
		- alternative: Cauchy's formula
	- dispersion sampling, two ways
		- single wavelength in a path tracer
		- trace normaly and add some random jitter to prevent from aliasing effects
	- index of refraction (IOR) depends on wavelength
	- light is split into its spectral elements
	- normal dispersion
		- rainbow
		- index of refraction decreases with wavelength
	- anomalous dispersion
		- index of refraction behaves non-lineary
		- partially reversed prismatic colours
	- dependency with absorbtion
		- IOR and absorbtion influence each other
		- there are Kramers-Kronig relations to calculate one from the other
		- anomalous dispersion occurs around absorbtion frequencies
	- extinction coefficient - how much something absorbs light (per mass or number of molecules)
	- experiment
		- take three solutions with different concetration of some special chemical
		- compare with prisms
		-> extinction coefficient doesn't influence IOR
	- rendering
		- for some materials, anomalous dispersion cannot be neglected 

- 13 scattering
	- blue of the sky
	= deflecting the direction of light in transparent environment
	- the air deflects rays of light
	- isn't dependent on aerosols in the air - it makes even the pure air
	- wavelength dependency - reason for blue sky and red sunsets

- 14 interference
	- butterfly wings
	- tiny structures can change the way the material looks like
	- small differences in the propagation of light can lead to cancellation or reinforcement
	- metallic and pearlescent colours
		- goniochromism - colour changes with viewing angle
		- micro and macro appearance differs
	- structural colour
		- extermely intense colours
		- highly resistent to UV
		- mechanically vulnerable
		- practically always change hue with viewing angle
	- pigment colour
		- doesn't change colour
		- less intense
		- tends to fade out with time (destroyed by UV)
		- 
	
- 15 difraction
	- opal, diffraction gratings
 
Solid colours vs. light
- in CIE Lab, L = 100 is white (<=> "light")

Band pass vs. band gap
- monochromatic colour
	- spectrum shows only narrow band in which the right colour goes
	- almost black
- band gap colours
	- caused by narrow gap in the band
	- almost white
	- spectrum shows everything but a small gap
- highly colourful paints have to be full colours or semichromes
- full colours have maximum colour content for given hue
- band limits have to be at complementary wavelengths
