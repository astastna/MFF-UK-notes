Research
- we usually don't see what has been done on the university
	- great part of funding for postgraduate students
- research takes a long time and is succesful only sometimes
- 55 000 a month for carrier in these projects
	- there exist a specific grant, which allow that
	-> think about postgraduate studium

Color reproduction
- colors are non-linear - on different surfaces the amount of color reflected differs
	- for example all red is reflected, but almost no green, etc.
	- (the teacher uses ColorSync Utility - color space for different printers can be shown)
	- the color space which can be shown on the monitor is different from the one which can be printed
		- cyan, dark green, purple - monitors are bad at that colors
		- on the other hand, printers can reproduce dark green quite well
		- it is not easy to print a magazine ...
		- what we see that bright green can be displayed but can't be printed 
			-> we have to get this color inside the color space of the printer somehow
			=> gamut mapping
Gamut mapping
- big gap between additive and subtractive methods
- story - one of his students discovered that one specie doesn't fit into picture when photographed
	-> trying to catch the real color of that animal, because it is very rare

	- global
		- we shift all colors to preserve the overall feeling from the picture
		- one would say that this is best for the photographs, beause contrast stays the same
		- however, nobody uses it in reality, because the colors are too pale then
		- instead, some non-linear shrinking is used
	- local 
		- we only change the colors which are outside the given space

Inkjets
- color inkjets are becoming rare nowdays
- big drawback - price of ink
		- ink dries up
- color quality is better then by laserjets
- modern color printer has 6 or 7 types of ink
	- dark and light cyan
	- dark and light magenta
	- yellow
	- dark and light black

- work well just on certain materials
	- on photographic paper the pictures are better than on normal paper
	- on the photographic paper has a small drains which make the ink to go deep and the resulting dots are smaller 

- types of heads
	- bubble head
		- we have a small pipe with ink
		- the end of the pipe is heated and a bubble of ink falls on the paper
		- we try to get smallest dots possible
		- ink requirements
			- not too liquid, so paper is not too softened
			- liquid enough to penetrate the paper
			- non-toxic, non-flammable
			- oh, wait, also colorful :D
	- piezo heads
		- only surviving to these days
		- Epson
		- print head is more expensive

Laser printers
	- fast
	- low cost per page
	- expensive
	- reduced gamut
	- not capable of any additional colours
	- in most cases no laser inside these days
	- basically computer controlled photocopier

	- electrostatic printing
		- invented in 1938 
		- we charge part of the paper and make the toner parts get there
		- it is possible to make it work also without computer
		- old photocopies were made only through group of lenses which transported the reflected light to charge some parts of paper
			-> reason for bad contrast of old copies
		- nowdays everywhere is negative charge and the laser gets it away in some parts
		- LED diods are often used instead of lasers because they work faster for wide printers 
		- but their spectrum is not uniform
	- toners
		- small particles
		- by inkjets, the ink physically over the paper
		- toner is on the surface
			-> reason for being waterproof
	- how to get the right amount of toner on the page?
		- brush - that wouldn't work after tousands of pages
		-> tiny iron particles on an electromagnet, after print the stream gets away, it falls to a reservoir
		- nowdays it is not needed any more, because the amount of toner pieces on the drum gets reduced to one layer by a shade
	- the laser printers are quite small, because basically you need the paper to go through and get charged

Offset printers
	- first printers which were compatible with digitalisation
		-> influenced the color representation in software
	- durability, speed, cheap for large volumes
		-> cheaper ink
	- companies printing newspapers order inks by tons, not kilograms
	- we have printing sheet from aluminium
	- the sheet is rough and when we give water on it, it sticks (precisely)
	- after the water, we put oily ink on the sheet and it sticks only to places where there's no water
	- there is an offset cylinder, to which gets the ink and from which the paper gets coloured
		- paper is soft and got squashed 
		- discovered by accident - a rubber cylinder under the sheet
			- one turn without paper
			- the next paper got ink from both sides and one side has been sharper
	- excellent gamut
	- additional colours possible - gold, silver, etc.
	- extreme speed
	- not suitable for small series
	- small offset printer - can be sutiable for tousands of pages

	- newspaper print - they don't need to use heat, because the ink gets quicly into the paper
	- magazines use different paper and heating is usually needed to get the ink into the paper
		-> different machines are used for magazines and newspapers

Pantone Hexachrome
- pantone standard for printers
- upper bound on what is possible to print
- 

Measurement technologies
	- photometry - intensity
		- basic unit - lumen
		- sensitivity of average human observer
		- spectrophotometry - doesn't make sense really, because we don't perceive the whole spectrum 
	- colorimetry - color value measuments
		- basically a single pixel camera
		- same for decades, only getting more user friendly
	- spectroradiometry - measuring the frequencies of the image
		- radiometry - electromagnetic stuff
		- spectroradiometry - electromagnetic radiation, with concern for human
		- units - Joules, Watts 
			- we measure energy per m^2, angle (and second) etc.
			- the same units are for radiometry, but with different subscript
				- tiny integral in definiton
		- when taking some light
			- radiometry counts everything under curve
			- photometry gives bad coefficient for spectra, which aren't perceived much by human and 
			a good coefficient to the important frequencies 
				-> multiplying by a "gaussian peak" of human sensitivity
