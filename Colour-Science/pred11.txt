White balance
	- what we do in computer to correct colors
Colour adaptation 
	- what our brani and eyes do, so we perceive the colours of the objects the same
	- no matter the light environment
Hue
- how differs the given light stimulus from red, green and blue

Lightness
- brightness relative to the brightness of white object perceived under the same conditions
 brightness / brightness of white

Brightness
- amount of light

Colorfulness
- perceived quantity of hue content in a stimulus

Saturation
- colorfulness of object realtive to it's own brightness

Chroma 
- colourfulness of an object relatively to the brightness of white object under similar viewing conditions

See presentation from Mr. Fairchild (from conference)

How luminance impacts color?
- high luminance display
	- why TV's aren't high luminance? it would be easier than 3D, HDR, ...
	-> colors behave differently
- eye trackers
	- if we know in which parts of the image people look the most
	- we can render well only that part
	- mostly not done because it is more problematic to measure it than to render it
	- but can be used by interactive rate-racing

- a whole technology can be built around color science

- a lot of scientific work is about meeting people and exchanging ideas
- interaction is needed
