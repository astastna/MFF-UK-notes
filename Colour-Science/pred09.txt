Digital printing
- we have whole pipeline of devices - scanner, monitor, ink printer, offset printer
	-> the goal is to make the picture seem the same on each of these devices
- it is problematic, because e.g. monitor has additive colours, but ink printer is subtractive
- solution:
	- PCS - Profile Connection Space (CIELAB)
		- colour space common for all devices
		- input is not the problem - colour spaces of input devices have usually smaller colour spaces
		- output is problem, because I have to know the parameters of output device and furthermore I go from larger space to smaller one
		-> I have to solve what to do with colours outside the colour space
			- there are more ways to do that as has been said during previous lessons
- we have to calibrate the devices
	- projector/monitor
		- a camera and program with specified colours
		- it measures the RGB curves and changes the input accordingly
	- printer
		- different printing technologies, papers, inks, ...
		- the printers are not calibrated, but built to fit a certain standard
			- Japanese standard
			- American standard
		- the data are in CMYK, it is better because the printers are calibrated to these pigments
		- however, then they are limited to implicit gamut of industry standard CMYK printers
		- L*a*b - perfect for this, but CMYK is still used

	- camera
		- Apple is using a small colour space - Apple RGB, new iPhones have P3
		- Adobe has a greater one
		- if I have 8 bits per chanell - in jpg each colour has 8 bits and too wide colour space, I have to waste more space for colour representation
		- PDF X	
			- acronym for PDF Exchange
		- HDR images
