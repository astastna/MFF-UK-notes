Measurements
- photometry, colorimetry - see previous lesson
- calibration of brightness measurements
	- could be done by different ways
	- shining of black body
		- around absolute zero
		- but this temperature is quite hard to obtain
	- reference lamps
		- instead, we use the shining of gold by a given temperature
		- gold is used because it doesn't oxidize
		- for example iron creates a layer of oxids around it when getting to high temperature
		-> gold is more accurate
		- now special lamps are created using this principle
		- burning time is limited
	- exactly calibrated detector
		- another possible way to do the calibration
		- it is quite difficult to create it
		- but by low temperatures it is possible and sometimes used
	- surface with exact reflection
		- used e.g. by photograpers, a table of appropriate material
		- table has different shades of grey and some basic colours
		-> photograph then can be normalized such that the colours the same as they really look like
- monochromators
	- devices which produce monochromatic light
	- prism monochromator
		- using two lens and a prism such that the wave length is normalized enough
	- grating type monochromator
		- it is possible to read a CD/DVD through it
		- uses mirrors and a grading table
		- light gets normalized through refraction
	- spectro-radiometer 
		- uses the principle of grating type monochromator
		- has something more on the beginning and end
	- filters
		- usually too wide-band
		- 
	- lyot filters
		- using liqid crystals
		- many layers, each one frequency band
	- lasers
		- expensive
		- inflexible - only one wave length
- there is lamp measurement lab
		- they measure characteristics of different tlamps
		- in Prague
		- 3D model of brightness
- viewing booths
	- special boxes with well-defined light environment
	- companies use it to compare their products and check that the colour is the right one
